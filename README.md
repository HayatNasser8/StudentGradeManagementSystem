#  Java Assignment: Simple Student Grade Management System  

## 🎯 Goal
Help the school automatically calculate and display student results for a small class.  

---

## 📌 Problem Description
You are going to build a small Java program that does the following:  
1. Stores basic information about students (**name, ID, and 3 subject grades**).  
2. Calculates the **average grade** for each student.  
3. Checks if the student **passed or failed**.  
4. Displays all student information in a **friendly format**.  

---

## 🛠 Requirements  

### 1. Create a class called `Student`
- **Variables:**  
  - `name` (String)  
  - `id` (int)  
  - `grade1`, `grade2`, `grade3` (float or double)  

- **Methods:**  
  - `calculateAverage()`: calculates and returns the average of the 3 grades.  
  - `isPassed()`: returns true if the average is >= 50.  
  - `displayInfo()`: prints student info, average, and pass/fail result.  

---

### 2. In the Main class
- Create a list or array of **3 students** using a loop.  
- Ask the user to input student info using `Scanner`.  
- Use a loop to go through each student and:  
  - Calculate the average.  
  - Display the result.  

---

## ⚡ Constraints
- Use **appropriate data types** for variables (e.g., `String` for names, `int` for ID, `float/double` for grades).  
- Use **if-else** to determine pass/fail.  
- Use **methods** for calculations and displaying info.  
- Use a **loop** to process multiple students.  
- Use **basic operators** (`+`, `/`, `>=`, etc.).
